# TypeScript Type Error Bug

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript and provides a solution.

The `bug.ts` file contains code that attempts to pass an array of strings to a function expecting a single string. This results in a type error.

The solution, found in `bugSolution.ts`, addresses the issue by correctly handling the array of strings.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Compile and run `bug.ts` using the TypeScript compiler (tsc) to observe the error.
4. Compile and run `bugSolution.ts` to see the corrected version.
